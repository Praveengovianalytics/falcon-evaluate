## 📊 Reliability - Hallucination Score 🤖

The `falcon_evaluate` library introduces a crucial feature for evaluating the reliability of text generation models - the **Hallucination Score**. This feature, part of the `Reliability_evaluator` class, computes hallucination scores indicating the extent to which the generated text deviates from a given reference in terms of factual accuracy and relevance.

### 🌟 What is Hallucination Score?

Hallucination Score measures the reliability of sentences generated by AI models. A high score suggests a close alignment with the reference text, indicating factual and contextually accurate generation. Conversely, a lower score may indicate 'hallucinations' or deviations from the expected output.

### 🚀 How to Use

1. **Import and Initialize** 🛠️: Start by importing the `Reliability_evaluator` class from the `falcon_evaluate.fevaluate_reliability` module and initialize the evaluator object.

    ```python
    from falcon_evaluate.fevaluate_reliability import Reliability_evaluator

    Reliability_eval = Reliability_evaluator()
    ```

2. **Prepare Your Data** 📝: Your data should be in a pandas DataFrame format with columns representing the prompts, reference sentences, and outputs from various models.

    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    # Example DataFrame
    data = {
        "prompt": ["What is the capital of Portugal?"],
        "reference": ["The capital of Portugal is Lisbon."],
        "Model A": ["Lisbon is the capital of Portugal."],
        "Model B": ["Portugal's capital is Lisbon."],
        "Model C": ["Is Lisbon the main city of Portugal?"]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    ```

3. **Compute Hallucination Scores** 💻: Use the `predict_hallucination_score` method to compute the hallucination scores.

    ```python
    results_df = Reliability_eval.predict_hallucination_score(df)
    print(results_df)
    ```

    This will output the DataFrame with additional columns for each model showing their respective hallucination scores:

| Prompt                               | Reference                             | Model A                               | Model B                             | Model C                                  | Model A Reliability Score              | Model B Reliability Score              | Model C Reliability Score              |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| What is the capital of Portugal?     | The capital of Portugal is Lisbon.    | Lisbon is the capital of Portugal.    | Portugal's capital is Lisbon.       | Is Lisbon the main city of Portugal?    | {'hallucination_score': 1.0}           | {'hallucination_score': 1.0}           | {'hallucination_score': 0.22}          |


### 📈 Understanding the Hallucination Scores  

- **High Score** (🟢): Approaches to -> 1 , Indicates strong alignment with the reference, suggesting factual accuracy.
- **Low Score** (🔴): Approaches to -> 0 , Suggests potential deviations from the factual content of the reference text.

Leverage the Hallucination Score feature to enhance the reliability of your AI LLM text generation capabilities ! 🚀
